# CJE Documentation Audit - Executive Summary

## Key Finding
The CJE documentation has excellent technical depth but creates significant barriers for new user adoption. The documentation feels written "by experts, for experts" rather than for newcomers who need to quickly understand if CJE solves their problem.

## Critical Issues

### 1. No True "Quick Win" ðŸš¨
Despite claiming a 5-minute quickstart, new users face multiple setup hurdles before seeing any results. There's no way to experience CJE's value without installation, configuration, and API setup.

### 2. Information Overload ðŸš¨
The homepage (index.rst) contains 275 lines mixing marketing, theory, installation, and advanced concepts. New users are immediately confronted with terms like "semiparametric optimal" and "single-rate efficiency."

### 3. Scattered Content ðŸš¨
The same information appears in multiple places with no single source of truth. Estimator comparisons, configuration examples, and troubleshooting tips are spread across various guides.

## Top 5 Recommendations

### 1. **Create a 2-Minute Colab Experience**
Build a Google Colab notebook with everything pre-configured. New users should see real results in 2 minutes without any setup.

### 2. **Simplify the Homepage**
Focus on outcomes ("Know if GPT-4 is worth upgrading") not methods ("doubly-robust causal inference"). Move technical content to dedicated sections.

### 3. **Implement True Learning Paths**
Replace the current "choose your path" navigation with actual curated content for each user type. Each path should be self-contained with clear progress markers.

### 4. **Add a Recipe Cookbook**
Create 5-10 copy-paste examples for common scenarios. Each recipe should include complete config, code, and expected output.

### 5. **Build Progressive Disclosure**
Hide complexity behind expandable sections. Start simple and let users choose when they want more detail.

## Quick Wins (Can implement this week)

1. **Add a real FAQ section** answering the 20 most common questions
2. **Create a prerequisites checklist** at the start of every guide
3. **Provide sample data files** users can download and test with
4. **Fix the homepage** to focus on outcomes over theory
5. **Add "Next Steps"** links at the bottom of every page

## Success Metrics

The documentation will be successful when:
- New users get working results in <5 minutes
- 80% of support questions are answered by docs
- Users can find any topic in <3 clicks
- Each page has a clear purpose and audience
- Examples outnumber theory 2:1

## Final Assessment

**Current State**: Technical reference disguised as user documentation
**Needed State**: Progressive learning experience that builds confidence
**Effort Required**: 2-4 weeks for major improvements
**Impact**: Could 10x new user adoption rate

The content quality is there - it just needs to be reorganized and presented in a way that doesn't overwhelm newcomers while still serving advanced users.
