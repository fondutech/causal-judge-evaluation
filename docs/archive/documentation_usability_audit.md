# CJE Documentation Usability Audit

## Executive Summary

The CJE documentation shows strong technical depth but has significant usability issues that would impede new user adoption. While the content is comprehensive, the organization, navigation flow, and practical focus need substantial improvement to create a smooth onboarding experience.

## 1. Navigation Flow: **Score: 2/5** ❌

### Issues Found:

**Circular Navigation Patterns:**
- index.rst → "Start Here" button → start_here.rst → links back to other docs
- No clear linear progression through materials
- Multiple entry points create confusion about where to actually start

**Redundant Content:**
- Same estimator comparison table appears in index.rst, user_guide.rst, and likely elsewhere
- Configuration examples scattered across multiple guides
- No single source of truth for common topics

**Missing Navigation Aids:**
- No breadcrumbs to show current location
- No "previous/next" navigation between related topics
- Search functionality mentioned but not prominently accessible

### Recommendations:
1. Create a single, linear "Getting Started" flow that doesn't branch
2. Add breadcrumb navigation to all pages
3. Consolidate all estimator information into one canonical location
4. Add clear "Next: [Topic]" links at the bottom of each guide

## 2. Learning Path: **Score: 3/5** ⚠️

### Issues Found:

**Good Attempt at Personalization:**
- start_here.rst offers three tracks (Run/Integrate/Understand)
- Time estimates provided (5/30/45 minutes)
- Visual track cards are appealing

**But Execution Falls Short:**
- Track 1 (5 minutes) immediately links to quickstart.rst which is much longer than 5 minutes
- No actual curated content for each track - just links to existing docs
- Tracks don't actually customize the experience, just point to different starting points

**Prerequisites Confusion:**
- Installation not included in "5-minute" track
- API key setup buried in troubleshooting instead of upfront
- No clear dependency explanation (do I need all providers?)

### Recommendations:
1. Create actual track-specific content, not just navigation
2. Include realistic time estimates (setup + execution)
3. Build interactive notebooks for each track
4. Add a "Prerequisites Checklist" widget on the homepage

## 3. Clarity: **Score: 2/5** ❌

### Issues Found:

**Jargon Without Context:**
- "Off-policy evaluation" used before explanation
- "Teacher forcing" mentioned without definition
- "Single-rate efficiency" in the first page without context

**Overwhelming First Impression:**
- index.rst has 275 lines including complex theory references
- Mathematical notation appears before practical examples
- Paper citations mixed with getting-started content

**Inconsistent Abstraction Levels:**
- Jumps from "what is a policy?" to "semiparametric optimal"
- Mixes implementation details with high-level concepts
- No progressive disclosure of complexity

### Recommendations:
1. Create a glossary of terms with simple explanations
2. Move all theory/paper references to a dedicated section
3. Use collapsible sections for advanced content
4. Add "New to causal inference?" callout boxes with simple explanations

## 4. Practical Focus: **Score: 3/5** ⚠️

### Issues Found:

**Good Examples But Hard to Find:**
- Practical workflows exist but buried in long documents
- Code examples present but mixed with theory
- Real use cases mentioned but not demonstrated

**Missing "Recipe" Approach:**
- No quick "copy-paste" templates for common scenarios
- Config examples spread across multiple files
- No "cookbook" section for common tasks

**Incomplete End-to-End Examples:**
- Examples show code but not expected outputs
- No sample data provided for testing
- Missing "what success looks like" sections

### Recommendations:
1. Create a "Recipes" section with 5-10 common scenarios
2. Add downloadable example configs and data
3. Include expected outputs and success criteria
4. Build a "CJE in 10 lines of code" showcase

## 5. Search & Discovery: **Score: 2/5** ❌

### Issues Found:

**Poor Information Architecture:**
- Related content scattered across guides/tutorials/api sections
- No tagging or categorization system
- Troubleshooting info mixed into various guides

**Missing Discovery Features:**
- No FAQ section
- No "Related Topics" suggestions
- No quick reference cards or cheat sheets
- Search mentioned but not visible/prominent

**Findability Problems:**
- Critical info like "cje results command doesn't exist" buried in user guide
- API key setup in troubleshooting instead of installation
- No index of examples or use cases

### Recommendations:
1. Add a comprehensive FAQ page
2. Create topic tags and cross-references
3. Build a quick reference card (one-pager)
4. Add "Common Questions" sidebar to key pages

## Critical Issues for New Users

### 1. **No Real "Quick Win" Path**
Despite claiming a 5-minute quickstart, new users face:
- No mention of installation time
- No sample data provided
- API key setup not included in time estimate
- First example requires creating config files

### 2. **Overwhelming Entry Point**
The index.rst page tries to be everything:
- Marketing material
- Technical documentation  
- Theory reference
- Navigation hub

This creates cognitive overload for new users.

### 3. **Missing "Day 1" Content**
New users need but can't easily find:
- "Is CJE right for my use case?"
- "What do I need before starting?"
- "What does success look like?"
- "How do I debug when things go wrong?"

## Specific Improvements Needed

### Immediate (Quick Wins):
1. **Create a TRUE 5-minute quickstart:**
   ```python
   # quickstart.py - copy and run!
   from cje import quick_evaluate
   
   results = quick_evaluate(
       data="https://cje-examples.com/sample-data.csv",
       current_model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
       new_model="gpt-4",
       api_key="sk-..."  # Your OpenAI key
   )
   print(f"Improvement: {results.improvement:.1%}")
   ```

2. **Add a visual "Choose Your Path" flowchart** on the homepage

3. **Create a "Before You Start" checklist:**
   - [ ] Python 3.9+ installed
   - [ ] OpenAI/Anthropic API key
   - [ ] 100+ examples of your data
   - [ ] Clear evaluation criteria

### Short-term (1-2 weeks):
1. **Consolidate scattered content:**
   - Single estimators guide
   - Single configuration reference
   - Single troubleshooting guide

2. **Add practical templates:**
   - 5 downloadable config templates
   - Sample datasets for each use case
   - Jupyter notebooks for common workflows

3. **Improve navigation:**
   - Add breadcrumbs
   - Add prev/next links
   - Create a sitemap page

### Medium-term (1 month):
1. **Build interactive elements:**
   - Config builder wizard
   - Interactive estimator selector
   - Live API testing widget

2. **Create video tutorials:**
   - 5-minute setup walkthrough
   - Common workflows demonstration
   - Debugging session example

3. **Develop a "CJE Playground":**
   - Browser-based trial environment
   - Pre-loaded examples
   - No installation required

## Summary Score: 2.4/5

The CJE documentation has solid technical content but poor usability for new users. The main issues are:

1. **Overwhelming complexity** presented too early
2. **Scattered information** requiring multiple searches
3. **No true quick-win path** for beginners
4. **Missing practical focus** in early docs

The documentation feels written by experts for experts, not for newcomers. With the recommended improvements, particularly focusing on a genuine 5-minute success path and better information architecture, the documentation could become much more approachable while maintaining its technical depth.
