# CJE Documentation Improvement Action Plan

## Priority 1: Immediate Quick Wins (1-2 days)

### 1.1 Create True 2-Minute Experience
**Task**: Build a Google Colab notebook with everything pre-configured
- [ ] Pre-install CJE in the notebook
- [ ] Include 100-row sample dataset  
- [ ] Provide test API keys (rate-limited)
- [ ] Single cell that runs complete evaluation
- [ ] Clear output visualization

**Files to create**:
- `examples/quickstart_colab.ipynb`
- `examples/data/sample_support_chats.csv`

### 1.2 Fix Homepage Overwhelm
**Task**: Simplify index.rst to focus on outcomes
- [ ] Move current content to `technical_overview.rst`
- [ ] Create new minimal homepage (see examples)
- [ ] Add three clear CTAs: Try Now, Install, Learn
- [ ] Remove all math/theory from first page
- [ ] Add testimonial-style use cases

**Files to modify**:
- `docs/index.rst` (simplify)
- `docs/technical_overview.rst` (new, contains old index content)

### 1.3 Add Prerequisites Checklist
**Task**: Create clear "before you start" section
- [ ] Add to start of quickstart.rst
- [ ] Include in installation.rst
- [ ] Make it a reusable snippet
- [ ] Cover: Python version, API keys, data format

**Files to modify**:
- `docs/quickstart.rst`
- `docs/installation.rst`
- `docs/_snippets/prerequisites.rst` (new)

## Priority 2: Navigation & Structure (3-5 days)

### 2.1 Consolidate Scattered Content
**Task**: Single source of truth for each topic

**Estimators** (currently in 3+ places):
- [ ] Create `docs/reference/estimators.rst` as canonical source
- [ ] Replace all other instances with links
- [ ] Add redirect from old locations

**Configuration** (currently scattered):
- [ ] Expand `configuration_reference.rst` with ALL options
- [ ] Remove config examples from other guides
- [ ] Add configuration validator tool

**Troubleshooting** (mixed into guides):
- [ ] Expand `troubleshooting.rst` with all issues
- [ ] Add clear categories and search tags
- [ ] Remove troubleshooting from other docs

### 2.2 Implement Linear Learning Paths
**Task**: Create actual path content, not just navigation

**Path 1: First Evaluation** (15 min)
- [ ] `paths/first_evaluation/1_install.rst`
- [ ] `paths/first_evaluation/2_prepare_data.rst`
- [ ] `paths/first_evaluation/3_run.rst`
- [ ] `paths/first_evaluation/4_interpret.rst`

**Path 2: Production Setup** (45 min)
- [ ] `paths/production/1_architecture.rst`
- [ ] `paths/production/2_configure.rst`
- [ ] `paths/production/3_monitor.rst`
- [ ] `paths/production/4_deploy.rst`

### 2.3 Add Navigation Helpers
**Task**: Make it easy to know where you are
- [ ] Add breadcrumbs to Sphinx theme
- [ ] Add Previous/Next links to all guides
- [ ] Create visual sitemap page
- [ ] Add "Related Topics" section to each page

## Priority 3: Practical Content (1 week)

### 3.1 Create Recipe Cookbook
**Task**: Quick copy-paste solutions

**Files to create**:
- `docs/cookbook/compare_models.rst`
- `docs/cookbook/test_prompts.rst`
- `docs/cookbook/ab_test_analysis.rst`
- `docs/cookbook/small_data_evaluation.rst`
- `docs/cookbook/high_precision_validation.rst`

**Each recipe includes**:
- Problem statement (1-2 sentences)
- Complete config file
- Full code example
- Expected output
- Common variations

### 3.2 Add Missing FAQ
**Task**: Answer the questions users actually have
- [ ] Create `docs/faq.rst` with 20+ common questions
- [ ] Organize by category (Getting Started, Troubleshooting, etc.)
- [ ] Link from every major page
- [ ] Include "Ask a Question" link to GitHub

### 3.3 Provide Sample Data
**Task**: Let users experiment immediately
- [ ] Create `examples/data/` directory
- [ ] Add 5 different sample datasets
- [ ] Include data generation scripts
- [ ] Document data format clearly

## Priority 4: Polish & Usability (2 weeks)

### 4.1 Progressive Disclosure
**Task**: Hide complexity until needed
- [ ] Implement collapsible sections in Sphinx
- [ ] Mark all advanced content
- [ ] Add "New to X?" callout boxes
- [ ] Create glossary with hover definitions

### 4.2 Interactive Elements
**Task**: Make documentation more engaging
- [ ] Config builder widget (HTML/JS)
- [ ] Estimator selection quiz
- [ ] Interactive API playground
- [ ] Embedded result visualizations

### 4.3 Better Error Messages
**Task**: Make errors helpful, not frustrating
- [ ] Audit all error messages in code
- [ ] Add helpful context and solutions
- [ ] Link to relevant docs
- [ ] Include common fixes

## Priority 5: Long-term Improvements (1 month)

### 5.1 Video Content
- [ ] 2-minute overview video
- [ ] Installation walkthrough
- [ ] First evaluation tutorial
- [ ] Debugging common issues

### 5.2 CJE Playground
- [ ] Web-based trial environment
- [ ] No installation needed
- [ ] Pre-loaded examples
- [ ] Shareable results

### 5.3 Community Features
- [ ] User contribution guide
- [ ] Example gallery
- [ ] Community recipes
- [ ] Success stories

## Implementation Tips

### Use Templates
Create reusable templates for consistency:
```rst
.. _template_recipe:

Recipe: {Title}
===============

**Problem**: {One sentence description}

**Time**: {X} minutes

**Difficulty**: Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced

Solution
--------
{Config and code}

Expected Output
---------------
{What success looks like}

Common Variations
-----------------
{Adaptations}

Troubleshooting
---------------
{Common issues}

--------
{Related recipes}
```

### Measure Success
Track these metrics:
- Time to first successful evaluation
- Documentation search queries
- Support questions by topic
- User path through docs
- Bounce rate on key pages

### Get Feedback Early
- Share drafts with 3-5 new users
- Watch them use the docs
- Note where they get stuck
- Iterate based on feedback
