# CJE Codebase Review

## Overall Assessment

The codebase is generally well-organized but has some areas for improvement:

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Clear module separation**: Core CJE logic is separate from experiments
2. **Good test coverage**: 24 test files, 155 passing tests
3. **Clean API**: Simple `analyze_dataset()` function for common use
4. **No wildcard imports**: Good import hygiene
5. **Single source of truth**: No duplicate implementations of key functions

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

#### 1. Code Quality Issues
- **42 files with print statements** - Should use logging consistently
- **7 files with sys.exit** - Should only be in entry points
- **17 different main() functions** - Many standalone scripts

#### 2. Large Files (>20KB)
- `visualization/weight_dashboards.py` - Could be split
- `estimators/dr_base.py` - Already quite large
- `estimators/stacking.py` - Complex, could benefit from refactoring
- `estimators/calibrated_ips.py` - Core functionality, size is acceptable

#### 3. Documentation Issues
- Main README references `pip install causal-judge-evaluation` but package not on PyPI
- Some example code in README may be outdated

#### 4. Experiment Structure
- `arena_10k_simplified/` has both:
  - `ablations/` - Well-organized systematic experiments
  - `analysis/` - Separate analysis module
  - Some overlap in functionality between the two

#### 5. Minor Issues
- One TODO comment in `calibrated_ips.py` about moving calibration_info
- 155 relative imports - high but not necessarily problematic

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Replace print with logging** - Consistency and control
2. **Update README** - Ensure all examples work, clarify installation

### Medium Priority
1. **Consolidate analysis code** - Merge overlapping functionality
2. **Refactor large files** - Split visualization and complex estimators

### Low Priority
1. **Clean up standalone scripts** - Reduce number of main() functions
2. **Address TODO comment** - Move calibration_info as noted

```

## Conclusion

The codebase is fundamentally sound with good architecture. The main issues are:
1. Inconsistent use of print vs logging
2. Some redundancy between analysis modules
3. README needs updating

These are all fixable without major refactoring.
