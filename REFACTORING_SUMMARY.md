# CJE Pipeline Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the monolithic `run_experiment.py` (~1,800 lines) into a clean, modular pipeline architecture.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Modular Pipeline Architecture**
- Created `cje/pipeline/` module with isolated stages
- Each stage has single responsibility and clear interfaces
- Coordinator pattern orchestrates pipeline execution
- Content-based caching preserved at each stage

### 2. **Removed Tech Debt**
- ✅ Eliminated backward compatibility for `model` vs `model_name` 
- ✅ Standardized on `model_name` everywhere
- ✅ No legacy code since there are no users yet

### 3. **Improved Data Handling**
- Added `reward` field directly to `CJESample` schema
- Automatic extraction from meta field for cleaner code
- Proper validation at each stage

### 4. **Better Error Messages**
- Actionable error messages with suggested solutions
- Example: Missing rewards now suggests enabling oracle labeling

### 5. **Simplified APIs**
- Added `estimate_from_logs()` convenience method to estimators
- Combines fit() and estimate() for cleaner usage

### 6. **Stage Output Validation**
- Created decorator for validating stage outputs
- Catches errors early in the pipeline
- Ensures data consistency between stages

## Architecture

├── __init__.py
├── coordinator.py      # Main pipeline orchestrator
├── config.py          # Pipeline configuration
├── validation.py      # Stage output validation decorator
└── stages/
    ├── __init__.py

    ├── judge.py       # Judge scoring
    ├── oracle.py      # Oracle labeling (optional)
    ├── calibration.py # Cross-fit calibration
    ├── target_policy.py   # Target policy evaluation
    └── estimation.py  # Final estimation

```

## Testing
- All existing tests pass ✅
- Created comprehensive test verifying all improvements
- Linting (black + mypy) passes ✅

## Usage
The refactored pipeline maintains the same external API:
```python
from cje.pipeline import CJEPipeline, PipelineConfig

config = PipelineConfig(...)
pipeline = CJEPipeline(config)
results = pipeline.run()
```

## Benefits
1. **Maintainability**: Each stage can be modified independently
2. **Testability**: Isolated stages are easier to unit test
3. **Extensibility**: New stages can be added without touching existing code
4. **Debuggability**: Clear stage boundaries make debugging easier
5. **Performance**: Preserved content-based caching at each stage

## No Breaking Changes for Users
Since there are no users yet, we took the opportunity to:
- Remove all backward compatibility code
- Standardize naming conventions
- Simplify APIs
- Clean up tech debt

This refactoring sets a clean foundation for future development.
