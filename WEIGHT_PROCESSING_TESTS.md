# Weight Processing Unit Tests

This document describes the unit tests added to cover critical gaps in the weight processing pipeline.

## Overview

The weight processing pipeline is a critical component of CJE that handles importance weight computation through multiple stages:
1. Float64 casting to prevent overflow
2. Hard clipping at ±20 in log space
3. Soft stabilization using 75th percentile subtraction
4. ESS (Effective Sample Size) calculation
5. Weight statistics collection

## Tests Added

### 1. Hard Clipping at Boundaries (`test_hard_clipping_at_boundaries`)
- **Purpose**: Verify that extreme log ratios are clipped exactly at ±20
- **Prevents**: Weight explosion leading to numerical instability
- **Example**: Log ratio of 60 → clipped to 20 → weight = exp(20)

### 2. Float64 Overflow Prevention (`test_float64_overflow_prevention`)
- **Purpose**: Ensure float64 casting prevents overflow in matrix operations
- **Prevents**: Float32 overflow when subtracting large opposite-sign numbers
- **Validates**: No infinities or NaNs in final weights

### 3. Soft Stabilization Preserves Diversity (`test_soft_stabilization_preserves_diversity`)
- **Purpose**: Verify that stabilization preserves relative weight differences
- **Prevents**: All weights collapsing to same value (winner-take-all)
- **Validates**: Policy preference ordering is maintained

### 4. ESS Calculation Correctness (`test_ess_calculation_correctness`)
- **Purpose**: Test that ESS is calculated and reported correctly
- **Validates**: 
  - Perfect overlap → ESS ≈ n
  - Poor overlap → ESS << n
  - Statistics are properly collected

### 5. Teacher Forcing Regression (`test_teacher_forcing_regression`)
- **Purpose**: Ensure identical policies produce identical weights
- **Prevents**: Teacher forcing bug where same policy gets different weights
- **Critical for**: Self-evaluation scenarios

### 6. Weight Statistics Collection (`test_weight_statistics_collection`)
- **Purpose**: Verify all weight statistics are collected correctly
- **Validates**:
  - Weight range reporting
  - Clipping detection and fraction
  - Stabilization status
  - ESS values and percentages

### 7. Stabilization Trigger Conditions (`test_stabilization_trigger_conditions`)
- **Purpose**: Test when stabilization is applied vs not applied
- **Validates**: Stabilization only triggers for large log differences (>10)

### 8. Edge Cases
- Empty inputs handling
- Mismatched input lengths
- Numerical edge cases (-inf log probabilities)

## Why These Tests Matter

1. **Prevent Regressions**: The weight processing pipeline has had multiple bugs (teacher forcing, overflow, etc.) that these tests will catch if reintroduced.

2. **Numerical Stability**: Weight computation involves exp() of large numbers, making it prone to overflow. These tests ensure our safeguards work.

3. **Correctness**: ESS and weight statistics are critical for reliability assessment. Incorrect calculations could lead to false confidence in results.

4. **Maintainability**: Unit tests for individual stages make it easier to refactor or optimize without breaking functionality.

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run only weight processing tests
python -m pytest tests/test_weight_processing.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/test_weight_processing.py --cov=cje.loggers.multi_target_sampler
```

## Future Improvements

While these tests cover the critical gaps, potential future enhancements could include:
- Property-based testing for weight processing stages
- Performance benchmarks for large-scale weight computation
- Integration tests with real model outputs
- Tests for weight calibration in estimators
