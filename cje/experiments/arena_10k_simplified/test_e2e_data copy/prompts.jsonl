{"prompt_id": "arena_74", "prompt": "Explain this:\nLarge pretrained Transformer language models have been shown to exhibit zeroshot generalization, i.e. they can perform a wide variety of tasks that they were\nnot explicitly trained on. However, the architectures and pretraining objectives\nused across state-of-the-art models differ significantly, and there has been limited\nsystematic comparison of these factors. In this work, we present a large-scale\nevaluation of modeling choices and their impact on zero-shot generalization. In\nparticular, we focus on text-to-text models and experiment with three model architectures (causal/non-causal decoder-only and encoder-decoder), trained with\ntwo different pretraining objectives (autoregressive and masked language modeling), and evaluated with and without multitask prompted finetuning. We train\nmodels with over 5 billion parameters for more than 170 billion tokens, thereby\nincreasing the likelihood that our conclusions will transfer to even larger scales.\nOur experiments show that causal decoder-only models trained on an autoregressive language modeling objective exhibit the strongest zero-shot generalization\nafter purely unsupervised pretraining. However, models with non-causal visibility on their input trained with a masked language modeling objective followed\nby multitask finetuning perform the best among our experiments. We therefore\nconsider the adaptation of pretrained models across architectures and objectives.\nWe find that pretrained non-causal decoder models can be adapted into performant\ngenerative", "language": "English"}

Our economy is dominated by tourism and many people here wish we could\ndiversify into some other areas so our economy could be more resilient.\nWe have ocean rights to around 40,000 sq-miles of ocean.\nOne idea I would like to \nexplore is using seasteads to do ocean fertilization to grow more plankton, so grow more fish, so we could fish\nmore without depleting fish stocks.   \nWe could have the seastead we are living on stay in the center of a large Eddy current.\nThen maybe twice a day we could use flying agriculture drone or a small boat drone to spread some fertilizer in the\n1 sq-km around the seastead.  \nWe would do a small amount of fertilizer like 20 lbs the first day and increase gradually to 200 lbs per day.\nWe plan to fly a multi-spectral drone to collect data.   We also plan to take water samples\nfrom near the seastead and do tests on those.   We would start data collection a few days before\nfertilization started so we had a baseline.\nWhat types of test should we do on the water samples?\nWhat other data collection could we do? \nWhat data would indicate something bad was happening and we should stop the experiment?\nFor now please ignore carbon sequestration, the politics and legality questions.", "language": "English"}
