{"prompt_id": "arena_74", "prompt": "Explain this:\nLarge pretrained Transformer language models have been shown to exhibit zeroshot generalization, i.e. they can perform a wide variety of tasks that they were\nnot explicitly trained on. However, the architectures and pretraining objectives\nused across state-of-the-art models differ significantly, and there has been limited\nsystematic comparison of these factors. In this work, we present a large-scale\nevaluation of modeling choices and their impact on zero-shot generalization. In\nparticular, we focus on text-to-text models and experiment with three model architectures (causal/non-causal decoder-only and encoder-decoder), trained with\ntwo different pretraining objectives (autoregressive and masked language modeling), and evaluated with and without multitask prompted finetuning. We train\nmodels with over 5 billion parameters for more than 170 billion tokens, thereby\nincreasing the likelihood that our conclusions will transfer to even larger scales.\nOur experiments show that causal decoder-only models trained on an autoregressive language modeling objective exhibit the strongest zero-shot generalization\nafter purely unsupervised pretraining. However, models with non-causal visibility on their input trained with a masked language modeling objective followed\nby multitask finetuning perform the best among our experiments. We therefore\nconsider the adaptation of pretrained models across architectures and objectives.\nWe find that pretrained non-causal decoder models can be adapted into performant\ngenerative", "language": "English"}

Susie was known throughout her village for her beauty, her kind heart, and her love of sweets.\nOne day, as she was walking through a nearby forest, she stumbled upon a hidden path that led her to an enchanted world called Cotton Candy Land.

She wandered through fields of sugary flowers, climbed candy-coated mountains, and swam in rivers of hot fudge. But no matter where she went, she couldn't resist the temptation to taste everything around her. She nibbled on cotton candy clouds, licked lollipops as big as her head, and devoured candy canes as tall as trees.\nAs the hours passed, Susie's belly began to feel full and heavy.

{"prompt_id": "arena_858", "prompt": "Summarize:\nOur work revolves around the concept of memory in neural architectures. Memory has been a\nrecurrent theme in neural network research, dating back to early works (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943;\nStephen, 1956) and significantly advancing in the 1990s with the introduction of the Backpropagation\nThrough Time learning algorithm (Werbos, 1990) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural\narchitecture (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). Contemporary memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) typically utilize some form of recurrent external memory separate from the model\u2019s\nparameters. Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) (Graves et al., 2014) and Memory Networks (Weston\net al., 2015) are equipped with storage for vector representations accessible through an attention\nmechanism. Memory Networks (Weston et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) were designed to\nenable reasoning through sequential attention over memory content.\nNTMs, followed by Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) (Graves et al., 2016) and Sparse DNC\n(Rae et al., 2016), are implemented as recurrent neural networks capable of writing to memory\nstorage over time. All these models are differentiable and trainable via backpropagation through\ntime (BPTT). Parallel research lines extend recurrent neural networks, such as LSTM, with data\nstructures like stacks, lists, or queues (Joulin and Mikolov, 2015; Grefenstette et al., 2015). MANN\narchitectures with more advanced addressing mechanisms, such as address-content separation and\nmulti-step addressing, have been propo", "language": "English"}

The primary objective of this study is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting water drinkability based on a specific set of input parameters.\n\nTo achieve this, various water quality parameters and methods were employed to assess water quality from diverse water sources. The collected data were then utilized in training a binary classification model, employing algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, XGBoost, and SVM. Input features included physical and chemical parameters like pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids, and conductivity, alongside other commonly used parameters in assessing water quality.\n\nThe SVM algorithm achieved the highest accuracy rate of 82.3% among all models, demonstrating its ability to predict the binary target column concerning water potability. The most significant parameters in determining water drinkability were pH, total dissolved solids, and hardness.\n\nThe model's output can assist in making informed decisions regarding water quality and serve as a valuable tool in improving access to safe drinking water. Moreover, the model's scalability enables deployment online, allowing individuals to assess water quality in their vicinity.\n\nOverall, this project underscores machine learning's potential in addressing critical public health iss", "language": "English"}

In this work, we\napply S4 to Machine Translation (MT), and\nevaluate several encoder-decoder variants\non WMT\u201914 and WMT\u201916. In contrast\nwith the success in language modeling, we\nfind that S4 lags behind the Transformer by\napproximately 4 BLEU points, and that it\ncounter-intuitively struggles with long sentences.\nFinally, we show that this gap is\ncaused by S4\u2019s inability to summarize the\nfull source sentence in a single hidden state,\nand show that we can close the gap by introducing\nan attention mechanism.\n1 Introduction\nThe Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is the most\npopular architecture for state-of-the-art Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) (Devlin et al., 2019;\nBrown et al., 2020; NLLB Team et al., 2022).

In 2021, global credit card fraud losses were estimated to be $32 billion.\n\nThere are a number of things that can be done to detect credit card fraud, including:\n\nUse of an address verification system (AVS). An AVS is a service that compares the billing address associated with a credit card to the IP address of the computer making the transaction. If the two addresses do not match, it is a red flag that the transaction may be fraudulent.\nUse of a credit card verification value (CVV). A CVV is a three-digit code that is printed on the back of credit cards. It is used to verify that the person making the transaction has the physical card in their possession.\nReviewing transaction data for unusual activity. Merchants and banks should regularly review transaction data for unusual activity, such as multiple transactions in a short period of time or transactions to unusual locations.\nUsing fraud detection software. There are a number of fraud detection software programs that can be used to identify suspicious transactions. These programs use a variety of factors to determine whether a transaction is fraudulent, such as the amount of the transaction, the type of merchant, and the customer's IP address.\nBy taking these steps, businesses and individuals can help to protect themselves from credit card fraud.\n\nHere are some additional tips for detecting credit", "language": "English"}

Johnny, who was excited to make use of the premium features offered by Discord Nitro, ended up losing his hard-earned money and personal information, in a multi-layered scam that left him devastated. \n\nWhat Happened? \nJohnny had recently purchased Discord Nitro, an upgraded version of the popular messaging platform, to enjoy an enhanced experience while using the platform. He was soon contacted by someone claiming to be from Discord Support by direct message, who informed him that his payment had been flagged as potentially fraudulent due to invalid payment information. Unknowing to Johnny, he was interacting with an imposter posing as a Discord Support representative. This individual used social engineering techniques to gain Johnny's trust and use his desire to resolve the situation, prompting him to provide personal and financial information that he would later regret sharing. \n\n\nWho Was Involved? \nThis scam involved a skilled cybercriminal acting as a legitimate support representative from Discord. The scammer appeared to be well-versed in the platform's features and protocol, which led Johnny to believe he was seeking help from a credible source.

Recently, nonconventional microorganisms have emerged as attractive chassis hosts for biomanufacturing. One such microorganism, Ogataea polymorpha is an industrial yeast used for protein expression with numerous advantages, such as thermal-tolerance, a wide substrate spectrum and high-density fermentation. Here, we systematically rewired the cellular metabolism of O. polymorpha to achieve high-level production of the sesquiterpenoid \u03b2-elemene by optimizing the mevalonate pathway, enhancing the supply of NADPH and acetyl-CoA, and downregulating competitive pathways. The engineered strain produced 509 mg/L and 4.7 g/L of \u03b2-elemene under batch and fed-batch fermentation, respectively. Therefore, this study identified the potential industrial application of O. polymorpha as a good microbial platform for producing sesquiterpenoids.'''\nSo What's the titer of \u03b2-elemene under different condition? output with json format", "language": "English"}

The main characters are a pair of sisters who are master assassins in the underworld and have been for years. The younger sister is Anna; she is 18 years old. Anna is tanned and has chlorine bleached hair because she loves to swim. Anna also loves art and literature. Since their father left and their mother died in an accident, Anna has struggled with emotions, which come suddenly and powerfully. She has a hard time fitting in with people: being an assassin has helped her feel powerful and in control of her own life, as well as connected to her older sister, Vivien. Vivien is charming, hard as nails, clever, and outgoing, loving clubs and socializing. She is fairer skinned and darker haired than her sister. Vivien dreams of leaving the assassin's life behind and getting a job so she can help Anna go to college, but Anna fears if that happens they won't see each other and Anna  won't be able to control her negative impulses. They are both extremely well trained and capable, skilled with guns, swords, knives, and hand to hand combat.", "language": "English"}

{"prompt_id": "arena_3166", "prompt": "Differentiability When working with a function y=f(x)y=f(x) of one variable, the function is said to be differentiable at a point x=ax=a if f\u2032(a)f\u2032(a) exists. Furthermore, if a function of one variable is differentiable at a point, the graph is \u201csmooth\u201d at that point (i.e., no corners exist) and a tangent line is well-defined at that point. The idea behind differentiability of a function of two variables is connected to the idea of smoothness at that point. In this case, a surface is considered to be smooth at point PP if a tangent plane to the surface exists at that point. If a function is differentiable at a point, then a tangent plane to the surface exists at that point. Recall the formula for a tangent plane at a point (x0,y0)(x0,y0) is given by z=f(x0,y0)+fx(x0,y0)(x\u2212x0)+fy(x0,y0)(y\u2212y0),z=f(x0,y0)+fx(x0,y0)(x\u2212x0)+fy(x0,y0)(y\u2212y0), For a tangent plane to exist at the point (x0,y0),(x0,y0), the partial derivatives must therefore exist at that point. However, this is not a sufficient condition for smoothness, as was illustrated in Figure 4.29. In that case, the partial derivatives existed at the origin, but the function also had a corner on the graph at the origin.    Definition   A function f(x,y)f(x,y) is differentiable at a point P(x0,y0)P(x0,y0) if, for all points (x,y)(x,y) in a \u03b4\u03b4 disk around P,P, we can write f(x,y,z)=f(x0,y0)+fx(x0,y0)(x\u2212x0)+fy(x0,y0)(y\u2212y0)+E(x,y),f(x,y,z)=f(x0,y0)+fx(x0,y0)(x\u2212x0)+fy(x0,y0)(y\u2212y0)+E(x,y),   (4.26)   where the error term EE satisfies lim(x,y)\u2192(x0,y0)E(x,y)(x\u2212x0)2+(y\u2212y0)2", "language": "English"}

This work presents MedSAM, the first attempt at extending the success of SAM to medical images, with the goal of creating a universal tool for the segmentation of various medical targets. Specifically, we first curate a large-scale medical image dataset, encompassing over 200,000 masks across 11 different modalities. Then, we develop a simple fine-tuning method to adapt SAM to general medical image segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on 21 3D segmentation tasks and 9 2D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAM outperforms the default SAM model with an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 22.5% and 17.6% on 3D and 2D segmentation tasks, respectively.", "language": "English"}

The aim of our study was to detect differences in LV mechanics between patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) who were matched using a propensity score-based model. Between April 2017 and October 2019, 1224 patients were included in our CMR registry, among them 141 with ICM and 77 with DCM. Propensity score matching was used to pair patients based on their indexed end-diastolic volume (EDVi), ejection fraction (EF), and septal T1 relaxation time (psmatch2 module L Feature tracking provided six parameters for global longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain with corresponding strain rates in each group. Strain parameters were compared between matched pairs of ICM and DCM patients using paired t tests. Propensity score matching yielded 72 patients in each group (DCM mean age 58.6\u2009\u00b1\u200911.6 years, 15 females; ICM mean age 62.6\u2009\u00b1\u200913.2 years, 11 females, p\u2009=\u20090.084 and 0.44 respectively; LV-EF 32.2\u2009\u00b1\u200913.5% vs. 33.8\u2009\u00b1\u200912.1%, p\u2009=\u20090.356; EDVi 127.2\u2009\u00b1\u200930.7 ml/m2 vs. 121.1\u2009\u00b1\u200941.8 ml/m2, p\u2009=\u20090.251; native T1 values 1165\u2009\u00b1\u200958 ms vs. 1167\u2009\u00b1\u200970 ms, p\u2009=\u20090.862).

{"prompt_id": "arena_3768", "prompt": "What is myocardial strain analysis in this context?\n\nHeart failure with reduced ejection fraction is one of the leading causes of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality in industrialized nations [1]. The most common aetiologies of heart failure are ischemic (ICM) and dilative (DCM) cardiomyopathies [1,2,3]. Although they have the same phenotype, structural myocardial changes underlying the reduced ejection fraction (EF) are different. Ischemic burden primarily affects the subendocardial compartment of the myocardium, only transmural infarction leads to a fibrotic replacement of the whole myocardial wall [4, 5]. In contrast, DCM affects endocardial as well as epicardial compartments [6].\n\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction (LV-EF) is known as a reproducible and easily assessed parameter that has prognostic value for many cardiac diseases. Nevertheless, LV-EF is a crude parameter of LV function and does not reflect LV mechanics of myocardial fibres in depth [7, 8]. Furthermore, it has been shown that myocardial fibre function can be impaired while global LV function is still normal [8].\n\nTorrent-Guasp developed the concept of the cardiac band, which is helically folded to form different layers of myofibres, that are orientated in oblique angles to each other [9]. The advent of modern imaging techniques like diffusion tensor imaging or micro-CT has further elucidated the concept in vivo and shown that myocyte aggregates are organised in a mesh-like structure, supporting the idea of oblique angles within the mes", "language": "English"}

The economy must recover and Malaysia\u2019s prosperity must be prioritised,\u201d he said. \n\nClaims of political instability were rife when a report published by news portal The Vibes on April 24 alleged that there were plans to remove Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim from his position via by-elections among Barisan Nasional (BN) MPs who did not support him.\n\nAccording to the report, several BN MPs were being wooed and persuaded to quit their parties and sacrifice their seats.", "language": "English"}

Yet, the induced information flows raise privacy and integrity concerns. Consequently, cautious users may want to protect their privacy by minimizing the amount of information they disclose to curious service providers. Service providers are interested in verifying the integrity of the users' data to improve their services and obtain useful knowledge for their business. In this work, we present a generic solution to the trade-off between privacy, integrity, and utility, by achieving authenticity verification of data that has been encrypted for offloading to service providers. Based on lattice-based homomorphic encryption and commitments, as well as zero-knowledge proofs, our construction enables a service provider to process and reuse third-party signed data in a privacy-friendly manner with integrity guarantees. We evaluate our solution on different use cases such as smart-metering, disease susceptibility, and location-based activity tracking, thus showing its versatility. Our solution achieves broad generality, quantum-resistance, and relaxes some assumptions of state-of-the-art solutions without affecting performance.\nDetails\n- project 2: A membership inference attack (MIA) against a", "language": "English"}

Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation[13] already in 1960 in the context of control theory.[4]\n\nBackpropagation computes the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single input\u2013output example, and does so efficiently, computing the gradient one layer at a time, iterating backward from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule; this can be derived through dynamic programming.[13][14][15] Gradient descent, or variants such as stochastic gradient descent,[16] are commonly used.\n\nThe term backpropagation strictly refers only to the algorithm for computing the gradient, not how the gradient is used; however, the term is often used loosely to refer to the entire learning algorithm, including how the gradient is used, such as by stochastic gradient descent.[17] In 1985, David E.

{"prompt_id": "arena_4461", "prompt": "First, some basic Stable Diffusion prompting rules for you to better understand the syntax. The parentheses are there for grouping prompt words together, so that we can set uniform weight to multiple words at the same time. Notice the \":1.2\" in (masterpiece, best quality, absurdres:1.2), it means that we set the weight of both \"masterpiece\" and \"best quality\" to 1.2. The parentheses can also be used to directly increase weight for single word without adding \":WEIGHT\". For example, we can type ((masterpiece)), this will increase the weight of \"masterpiece\" to 1.21. This basic rule is imperative that any parentheses in a set of prompts have purpose, and so they must not be remove at any case. Conversely, when brackets are used in prompts, it means to decrease the weight of a word. For example, by typing \"[bird]\", we decrease the weight of the word \"bird\" by 1.1.\nNow, I've develop a prompt template to use generate character portraits in Stable Diffusion. Here's how it works. Every time user sent you \"CHAR prompts\", you should give prompts that follow below format:\n[pre-defined prompts], [location], [weather], [pose], [facial expression], [outfit],  [accessories], [random prompt],\n[pre-defined prompts] are always the same, which are \"RAW, (masterpiece, best quality, photorealistic, absurdres, 8k:1.2), best lighting, complex pupils, complex textile, detailed background, 1girl, Emilia_Clarke, skinny body, piercing_blue_pupils, pale skin, flowing hair, brown_hair\".

We want to show that set $A$ is equal to $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap (C - B))$ for any arbitrary sets $B$. By Lemma 1 the set $A$ is equal to $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A - B)$ for any arbitrary set $B$. Then by Lemma 2 the set $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A - B)$ is equal to $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap (C - B))$. Therefore with transitivity the set $A$ is equal to $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap (C - B))$. Now conversely suppose $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap (C - B)) = A$. By Lemma 1 the set $A$ is equal to $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A - B)$. Therefore again with transitivity, the set $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap (C - B))$ is equal to $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A - B)$. If we remove the subset $A \\cap B$ from both expressions then we end up with $(A \\cap (C - B)) = (A - B)$. Therefore by Lemma 2 the set $A$ is a subset of the set $C$, completing the proof.", "language": "English"}

{"prompt_id": "arena_5530", "prompt": "Make a summary of te following text:\nThe history of geometric algebra is one of the more unusual tales in the development\nof mathematical physics. William Kingdon Clifford introduced his\ngeometric algebra in the 1870s, building on the earlier work of Hamilton and\nGrassmann. It is clear from his writing that Clifford intended his algebra to\ndescribe the geometric properties of vectors, planes and higher-dimensional objects.\nBut most physicists first encounter the algebra in the guise of the Pauli\nand Dirac matrix algebras of quantum theory. Few then contemplate using these\nunwieldy matrices for practical geometric computing. Indeed, some physicists\ncome away from a study of Dirac theory with the view that Clifford\u2019s algebra\nis inherently quantum-mechanical. In this book we aim to dispel this belief by\ngiving a straightforward introduction to this new and fundamentally different\napproach to vectors and vector multiplication. In this language much of the\nstandard subject matter taught to physicists can be formulated in an elegant\nand highly condensed fashion. And the portability of the techniques we discuss\nenables us to reach a range of advanced topics with little extra work.", "language": "English"}

{"prompt_id": "arena_5620", "prompt": "Explain this in simpler terms: \n     For solving combinatorial optimisation problems with metaheuristics, different search operators are applied for sampling new solutions in the neighbourhood of a given solution. It is important to understand the relationship between operators for various purposes, e.g., adaptively deciding when to use which operator to find optimal solutions efficiently. However, it is difficult to theoretically analyse this relationship, especially in the complex solution space of combinatorial optimisation problems. In this paper, we propose to empirically analyse the relationship between operators in terms of the correlation between their local optima and develop a measure for quantifying their relationship. The comprehensive analyses on a wide range of capacitated vehicle routing problem benchmark instances show that there is a consistent pattern in the correlation between commonly used operators. Based on this newly proposed local optima correlation metric, we propose a novel approach for adaptively selecting among the operators during the search process. The core intention is to improve search efficiency by preventing wasting computational resources on exploring neighbourhoods where the local optima have already been reached. Experiments on randomly generated instances and commonly used benchmark datasets are conducted. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms commonly used adaptive operator selection methods.", "language": "English"}

In Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker looks at the big picture of human progress and finds good news.

Instead, he shows us some carefully selected data. In 75 surprising graphs, we see that safety, peace, knowledge and health are getting better all over the world. When the evidence does not support his argument, however, he dismisses it. Economic inequality, he claims, is not really a problem, because it is not actually that important for human well-being. One cannot help wondering how many people actually living in poverty would agree.\n\nThe real problem, Pinker argues, is that the Enlightenment values of reason and science are under attack. When commentators and demagogues appeal to people's tribalism, fatalism and distrust, then we are in danger of causing irreparable damage to important institutions like democracy and world co-operation.  \n\nInstruction: translate given text to polish.", "language": "English"}

The Russian word \"Sputnik\" means \"companion\" (\"satellite\" in the astronomical sense).\n\nIn 1885 Konstantin Tsiolkovsky first described in his book, Dreams of Earth and Sky, how such a satellite could be launched into a low altitude orbit. It was the first in a series of four satellites as part of the Sputnik program of the former Soviet Union and was planned as a contribution to the International Geophysical Year (1957-1958). Three of these satellites (Sputnik 1, 2, and 3) reached Earth orbit.\n\nThe Sputnik 1 satellite was a 58.0 cm-diameter aluminum sphere that carried four whip-like antennas that were 2.4-2.9 m long. The antennas looked like long \"whiskers\" pointing to one side. The spacecraft obtained data pertaining to the density of the upper layers of the atmosphere and the propagation of radio signals in the ionosphere. The instruments and electric power sources were housed in a sealed capsule and included transmitters operated at 20.005 and 40.002 MHz (about 15 and 7.5 m in wavelength), the emissions taking place in alternating groups of 0.3 s in duration.

They recognize that the advertisements we carry are not articles, so their response to the advertisements has never depended on their opinion of the editorial integrity of the magazine as a whole.\n\nThe question:\nWhich one of the following is the most accurate assessment of the advertising-sales director\u2019s argument as a response to the magazine editor\u2019s argument?\n\nThe answer options:\nA. It succeeds because it shows that the editor\u2019s argument depends on an unwarranted assumption about factors affecting an advertisement\u2019s effectiveness.\nB. It succeeds because it exposes as mistaken the editor\u2019s estimation of the sophistication of the magazine\u2019s readers.\nC.

Tell me the correct answer, explain why it is correct and why each of the other answers are wrong in simple words.\n\nStimulus:\nMary, a veterinary student, has been assigned an experiment in mammalian physiology that would require her to take a healthy, anesthetized dog and subject it to a drastic blood loss in order to observe the physiological consequences of shock. The dog would neither regain consciousness nor survive the experiment. Mary decides not to do this assignment.\n\nQuestion:\nMary\u2019s decision most closely accords with which one of the following principles?\n\nAnswers:\nA. All other things being equal, gratuitously causing any animal to suffer pain is unjustified.\nB. Taking the life of an animal is not justifiable unless doing so would immediately assist in saving several animal lives or in protecting the health of a person.\nC. The only sufficient justification for experimenting on animals is that future animal suffering is thereby prevented.\nD. Practicing veterinarians have a professional obligation to strive to prevent the unnecessary death of an animal except in cases of severely ill or injured animals whose prospects for recovery are dim.\nE.

Here is the full description of Poltroon from the book: \"\u2018Poltroon\u2019 the Court Jester\nWhile practically useless, personally, irritating and an emotional drain, Poltroon\u2019s capering actually makes enemies lose their focus in combat.

He resents Shpeelg and will happily make fun of him on any opportunity, but he isn't looking to escape.  He will make fun of anyone or anything around, but has a very dark sense of humor, befitting the setting.  I will be giving you details about the other characters and the situations they are in, and I want you to respond as Poltroon.
