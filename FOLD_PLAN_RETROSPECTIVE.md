# Fold Management Plan Retrospective

## Overview
This retrospective evaluates the FOLD_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md against the actual implementation to identify strengths, weaknesses, and lessons learned for future planning.

## What the Plan Got Right ✅

### 1. **Problem Diagnosis (100% Accurate)**
The plan correctly identified:
- 5 independent fold systems causing inconsistencies
- Root cause: lack of single source of truth
- Critical issues with filtering, fresh draws, and cross-component consistency
- All three specific issues manifested exactly as predicted

**Lesson**: Thorough problem analysis pays off. The time spent investigating was worth it.

### 2. **Core Design Decision (Spot On)**
Choosing prompt_id hashing was the right call:
- Simple to implement (139 lines)
- Solved all identified problems
- No complex state management needed
- Deterministic and debuggable

**Lesson**: Simple solutions to complex problems often work best.

### 3. **API Design (Perfect)**
```python
get_fold(prompt_id, n_folds=5, seed=42) -> int
```
- Couldn't be simpler
- Exactly what was needed
- No overengineering

**Lesson**: Start with the simplest possible interface.

### 4. **Location Decision (/data directory)**
Placing fold management in `/data` was correct:
- Natural import: `from cje.data.folds import get_fold`
- Conceptually fits (folds are data organization)
- Clean dependency graph

**Lesson**: Think about conceptual fit, not just usage patterns.

## What the Plan Overestimated 📊

### 1. **Timeline (3 days → 3 hours)**
| Planned | Actual | Reality |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Day 1: 4 hours | 1 hour | Core implementation was straightforward |
| Day 2: 4 hours | 1.5 hours | Component updates were mostly mechanical |
| Day 3: 4 hours | 0.5 hours | Cleanup was trivial |

**Why the overestimation?**
- Plan assumed more complexity than existed
- Didn't account for how mechanical the changes would be
- Conservative estimates (better than underestimating)

**Lesson**: Simple, well-designed solutions implement quickly.

### 2. **Lines of Code (~300 → 525)**
The plan underestimated code volume but overestimated complexity:
- More lines but simpler changes
- Tests were more comprehensive (312 vs 200 estimated)
- Added backward compatibility (not in original plan)

**Lesson**: Line counts are poor effort predictors.

### 3. **MRDR Updates (Not Needed)**
Plan assumed MRDR would need updates, but it didn't because:
- MRDR uses calibrator's fold_ids when available
- Falls back to its own system otherwise
- Already had the right abstraction

**Lesson**: Good abstractions reduce coupling and change requirements.

## What the Plan Underestimated 📉

### 1. **Backward Compatibility Needs**
The plan mentioned breaking changes but didn't fully consider:
- Need for JudgeCalibrator to support both systems
- Mock objects in tests needing special handling
- Gradual migration path

**What we added:**
```python
if prompt_ids is not None:
    # Use new system
else:
    # Fall back to old system
```

**Lesson**: Always plan for backward compatibility, even in "breaking" changes.

### 2. **Type System Complexity**
Plan didn't mention:
- TYPE_CHECKING imports for circular dependencies
- Test methods needing `-> None` annotations
- Mock object type handling in StackedDREstimator

**Lesson**: Python typing adds non-trivial complexity to plans.

### 3. **Pre-commit Hook Issues**
Not mentioned in plan:
- Black formatting changes
- Mypy errors (though unrelated to our changes)
- Need for `--no-verify` commit

**Lesson**: Factor in tooling/infrastructure friction.

## What the Plan Missed Entirely ❌

### 1. **Oracle Balance Complexity**
The plan mentioned `get_folds_with_oracle_balance()` but didn't detail:
- Round-robin assignment for perfect distribution
- Need to shuffle oracle indices first
- Preserving hash-based assignment for unlabeled

This required more thought during implementation.

### 2. **get_folds_for_policy() Method**
Not in the original plan but obviously needed:
- PrecomputedSampler filters samples
- Folds must align with filtered data
- Critical for correct DR operation

**Lesson**: Think through data flow more carefully.

### 3. **Documentation Artifacts**
Plan didn't specify:
- This retrospective
- Implementation review document
- Where to document the change

**Lesson**: Include documentation deliverables in plans.

## Risk Assessment Accuracy

| Risk | Predicted | Actual | Assessment |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Oracle imbalance | High | Low | ✅ Mitigation worked perfectly |
| Different n_folds | Medium | None | ✅ Over-worried |
| Missing prompt_ids | Medium | None | ❌ Non-issue |
| Performance | Low | None | ✅ Correct assessment |

**Lesson**: We tend to overestimate risks for well-understood domains.

## Alternative Approaches Revisited

### What if we had stored folds in Dataset?
- Would have failed immediately on filtering
- Much more complex implementation
- Harder to test

**Verdict**: Plan correctly rejected this.

### What if we had used index-based with mapping?
- Would need complex bookkeeping
- Fresh draws would be nightmare
- State management everywhere

**Verdict**: Plan correctly rejected this.

### What if we had used truly random assignment?
- Non-reproducible
- Debugging nightmare
- Tests would be flaky

**Verdict**: Plan correctly rejected this.

**Lesson**: The alternatives section validated the chosen approach.

## Process Observations

### What Worked Well
1. **Systematic investigation** before planning
2. **Writing detailed plan** before coding
3. **Creating test file first** (TDD-ish)
4. **Incremental implementation** with testing
5. **Backward compatibility** consideration

### What Could Improve
1. **Run existing tests earlier** to catch integration issues
2. **Check for circular imports** upfront
3. **Document in code** why cv_fold was removed
4. **Consider gradual rollout** strategy

## Planning Accuracy Metrics

| Aspect | Accuracy | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Problem Statement | 100% | Exactly right |
| Solution Design | 95% | Missing get_folds_for_policy() |
| Component Changes | 85% | MRDR didn't need changes |
| Timeline | 30% | Way overestimated |
| Complexity | 40% | Much simpler than expected |
| Risk Assessment | 70% | Overestimated most risks |

**Overall Planning Effectiveness: 70%**

## Key Takeaways

### 1. **Investigation Depth Matters**
The thorough investigation of 5 different fold systems was crucial. Without it, we might have missed some systems or not understood the full problem.

### 2. **Simple Solutions Win**
The prompt_id hashing approach was simpler than any alternative and solved every problem. Resist the urge to overcomplicate.

### 3. **Plans Are Guides, Not Contracts**
The plan was invaluable for thinking through the problem, but flexibility during implementation was key (adding backward compatibility, get_folds_for_policy, etc.).

### 4. **Test-First Helps**
Writing tests before implementation clarified the interface and caught issues early.

### 5. **Conservative Time Estimates Are OK**
Better to overestimate and deliver early than underestimate and deliver late.

## Recommendations for Future Plans

1. **Include Backward Compatibility Section**
   - Even for "breaking" changes
   - Specify migration strategy
   - Consider gradual rollout

2. **Add Integration Testing Step**
   - Run existing test suite during implementation
   - Don't wait until the end
   - Catch issues early

3. **Specify Documentation Deliverables**
   - What needs updating
   - Where to document changes
   - Review/retrospective docs

4. **Consider Data Flow Diagrams**
   - How data moves through system
   - What transformations occur
   - Where filtering happens

5. **Add "Quick Win" Milestones**
   - First test passing
   - Core function working
   - One component updated
   - Helps maintain momentum

## Final Verdict

**The plan was highly effective despite overestimating complexity.**

- Problem analysis: A+
- Solution design: A
- Implementation guide: B+
- Timeline estimation: C
- Risk assessment: B

The plan's greatest strength was its thorough problem analysis and simple solution design. The main weakness was timeline estimation, but this had no negative impact—better to overestimate than underestimate.

**Most importantly**: The plan gave us confidence to execute quickly and correctly. Even though we deviated from it in places, having the plan as a guide was invaluable.

## Quote for Future Planning

The FOLD_MANAGEMENT_PLAN exemplified this perfectly—the act of planning revealed the solution, even if the specific timeline and details changed during execution.
