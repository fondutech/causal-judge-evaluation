# llama.cpp Integration Test Summary

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

1. **Added llama.cpp support** to `RobustTeacherForcing` with `provider="llama_cpp"`
2. **Fixed token boundary detection** for proper log probability extraction
3. **Added space handling** between prompt and response when needed
4. **Implemented caching** for efficiency

## 🔬 Test Results

### With TinyLlama Model

1. **Short responses (< 50 chars)**: Perfect determinism with temperature > 0
   - Importance weights are exactly 1.0 for pi0/pi_clone
   - Log probabilities are reasonable (range: -7 to -20)

2. **Long responses (> 100 chars)**: Some non-determinism with temperature > 0
   - Importance weights deviate from 1.0 (e.g., 0.48 instead of 1.0)
   - Issue appears to be inherent to llama.cpp with temperature > 0

3. **Temperature = 0**: Perfect determinism for ALL response lengths
   - This is the recommended setting for reproducible research

## 📊 Key Findings

1. **llama.cpp provides reasonable log probabilities**:
   ```
   Example: "The capital of France is Paris."
   Log prob: -11.435 (about -0.37 per character)
   ```

2. **Determinism behavior**:
   - Temperature 0: Always deterministic ✅
   - Temperature > 0: Deterministic for short texts, may vary for long texts
   - Seeds don't seem to affect results (possible llama.cpp limitation)

3. **Performance**: 
   - Fast computation with CPU (n_gpu_layers=0)
   - Model caching prevents redundant loading
   - Result caching for repeated queries

## 🎯 Recommendations for Arena 10K

1. **For perfect reproducibility**: Use `temperature=0.0`
   ```python
   tf = RobustTeacherForcing(
       provider="llama_cpp",
       model="path/to/model.gguf",
       temperature=0.0,  # Critical for determinism
       n_ctx=4096,
   )
   ```

2. **For matching Fireworks behavior**: Accept minor non-determinism
   - Use same temperature as Fireworks (e.g., 0.5 or 0.7)
   - Weight deviations are small for most responses

3. **Model recommendations**:
   - TinyLlama 1.1B: Good for testing (fast, small)
   - Llama 3 8B: Good balance of quality and speed
   - Llama 3 70B: Best quality but requires more resources

## 🚀 Usage Example

```python
from cje.utils import RobustTeacherForcing

# Create teacher forcing instance
tf = RobustTeacherForcing(
    provider="llama_cpp",
    model="~/models/llama-3-8b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf",
    temperature=0.0,  # For determinism
    seed=42,
    n_ctx=4096,
    n_gpu_layers=-1,  # Use all GPU layers
)

# Compute log probability
result = tf.compute_log_prob(prompt, response)
if result.is_valid:
    print(f"Log probability: {result.value}")
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. Seeds don't affect results (possible llama.cpp issue)
2. Temperature > 0 can cause non-determinism for long texts
3. Requires downloading GGUF model files locally
