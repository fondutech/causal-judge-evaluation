# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation that may be useful for reference but is not part of the active experiment documentation.

## Files

- **CLEANUP_CHECKLIST.md** - Records the reorganization from flat to two-phase structure
- **DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md** - Old navigation guide (superseded by main README)
- **IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW.md** - Historical code review notes
- **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Guide for migrating from old structure
- **ORACLE_LABELING_NOTES.md** - Detailed oracle labeling results and MTurk failure analysis

These files are kept for historical reference but should not be used as primary documentation.
