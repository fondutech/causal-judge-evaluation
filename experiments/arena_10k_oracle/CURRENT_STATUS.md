# Arena 10K Experiment - Current Status

## 🚀 Active Processes (as of last check)
1. **04c_score_targets_deterministic.py** - Running
2. **04d_score_targets_uncertainty.py** - Running  
3. **02c_compute_target_logprobs.py** - Running (teacher forcing)

## ✅ Completed Tasks
1. **Investigation of pi_bad scoring highest** - COMPLETE
   - Root cause: P0 log prob failures (-50.0) + distribution mismatch + SNIPS normalization
   - Created comprehensive analysis

2. **Fixed log probability error handling** - COMPLETE
   - api_policy.py now raises exceptions instead of returning 0.0
   - Teacher forcing scripts use None for failures instead of fake values
   - Added validation scripts

3. **Prepared P0 samples for re-scoring** - COMPLETE
   - Extracted 140 samples with -50.0 log prob
   - Created rescore_p0_failures.py script
   - Created validation scripts

## 📊 Current Data Status

### P0 Data (10,000 samples)
- ✅ P0 responses generated: 10,000/10,000
- ✅ P0 scored (deterministic): 10,000/10,000  
- ✅ P0 scored (uncertainty): 10,000/10,000
- ⚠️ P0 with valid log probs: 1,684/1,824 (140 have -50.0)

### Target Policy Data (30,000 samples - 3 policies × 10,000)
- ✅ Target responses generated: 30,000/30,000
- 🔄 Target scored (deterministic): ~4,000/30,000 (13%)
- 🔄 Target scored (uncertainty): ~3,700/30,000 (12%)

### Teacher Forcing Data
- 🔄 P0 with target log probs: 2,960/10,000 (30%)

## 🔧 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Monitor running processes** - They're progressing slowly but steadily
2. **Re-score P0 failures** - Run rescore_p0_failures.py for the 140 samples
3. **Wait for teacher forcing completion** - Currently at 30%

### Once Data is Complete
1. **Merge rescored P0 data** back into main dataset
2. **Run full CJE ablations** with complete data
3. **Compare results** with partial data results

## 📁 Files Created During Work
- Various analysis scripts in phase2_cje_ablations/
- Validation and extraction scripts
- Direct ablation runner (bypasses full pipeline)
- Visualization scripts

## 🗑️ Cleanup Done
- Removed all temporary .md analysis files
- Committed critical error handling fixes
- Organized scripts into appropriate directories

## ⚠️ Known Issues
1. **Slow progress** on scoring and teacher forcing (API rate limits)
2. **140 P0 samples** need re-scoring (have -50.0 log prob)
3. **Low ESS** (<7%) for all policies makes estimates unreliable

## 💡 Key Insights
1. Silent failures (returning 0.0) corrupt importance weights catastrophically
2. Distribution mismatch between policies is extreme (pi_bigger_model prefers short text)
3. SNIPS normalization can mask extreme weight issues
4. Data quality is paramount for off-policy evaluation
