However, they differ in their origins, design philosophies, and use cases.\n\n1. **Origin and Vendor Support**:\n   - **CUDA**: CUDA is a proprietary technology developed by NVIDIA. It is specifically designed to work with NVIDIA GPUs. This means that CUDA applications are generally limited to running on NVIDIA hardware, making it less versatile in terms of hardware compatibility compared to OpenCL.\n   - **OpenCL**: OpenCL is an open standard maintained by the Khronos Group, a consortium that includes a wide range of companies such as AMD, Apple, ARM, IBM, Intel, NVIDIA, and others. OpenCL is designed to be vendor-agnostic, meaning that OpenCL applications can theoretically run on a variety of hardware platforms, including GPUs from multiple vendors, CPUs, and FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays).\n\n2. **Programming Model**:\n   - Both CUDA and OpenCL provide a programming model that allows developers to execute code on heterogeneous devices.
