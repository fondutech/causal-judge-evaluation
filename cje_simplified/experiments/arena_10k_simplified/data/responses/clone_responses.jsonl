They have millions or even billions of parameters, which makes them challenging to adapt to new tasks or domains, especially when only a small amount of task-specific data is available.\n\n**What is LoRA?**\n\nLoRA is a method that allows for efficient adaptation of large language models to new tasks or domains by updating only a small subset of the model's parameters. The core idea is to use low-rank matrices to approximate the updates to the model's weights, rather than updating the entire weight matrix.\n\nIn essence, LoRA adds a small number of learnable, low-rank matrices to the original model's weights.

Create a training plan:**\nDevelop a personalized training plan that includes a mix of running, cross-training, and rest days. Aim to train for at least 16-20 weeks before the marathon. You can find many online resources, such as training plans and running apps, to help you create a schedule.\n\n**2. Build a base fitness level:**\nIf you're new to running, start by building a base fitness level with regular running and walking. Aim to run at least 3 times a week, with one shorter run (3-5 miles), one longer run (6-8 miles), and one mid-week run (4-6 miles).\n\n**3. Gradually increase mileage:**\nGradually increase your weekly mileage by no more than 10% each week. This allows your body to adapt to the demands of running long distances.\n\n**4.

This fluid-like behavior is thought to be related to the emergence of spacetime geometry and the behavior of gravity.\n\nOne of the key features of superfluids is their ability to exhibit \"non-classical\" behavior, such as quantum vortices and excitations that can propagate through the fluid.

Censorship helps to prevent the spread of false information, which can have serious consequences, such as inciting violence or influencing elections. Additionally, censorship can help to protect vulnerable individuals, such as children and minorities, from online abuse and bullying.\n\nFor example, in 2018, Facebook and Twitter removed hundreds of accounts linked to Russian trolls that were spreading misinformation and propaganda about the US presidential election. This move was seen as a necessary step to prevent the manipulation of public opinion and to protect the integrity of the democratic process.\n\nCensorship can also help to promote a safer and more respectful online environment. By removing hate speech and harassment, social media platforms can encourage users to engage in constructive and respectful conversations, rather than being exposed to toxic and abusive content.

They were then asked to associate the shapes with two made-up words: \"Kiki\" and \"Bouba\".\n\nThe result was that an overwhelming majority of people (around 98%) associated the jagged shape with \"Kiki\" and the soft shape with \"Bouba\". This effect has been replicated in many languages and cultures, suggesting that there's a universal, innate tendency to map certain sounds to certain shapes.\n\nSo, why is Kiki sharper than Bouba? The answer lies in the way our brains process sound and shape.\n\n1. **Sound symbolism**: \"Kiki\" has a sharp, high-pitched sound, which is often associated with sudden, sharp movements or objects.

Aristotle saw monarchy as a good form of government when the ruler is virtuous and just, but it can quickly become tyrannical if the ruler is self-serving or corrupt. He argued that a monarch's power should be limited by laws and institutions to prevent abuse.\n\n2. **Aristocracy** (Rule by the Best): An aristocracy is a system where power is held by a small group of wise and virtuous individuals who govern in the best interests of the state. Aristotle considered aristocracy to be the best form of government, as it allows for the collective wisdom and expertise of the ruling class to guide the state.

This can help signal to your child that it's time for sleep.\n2. **Create a sleep-conducive environment**: Make sure the room is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature. Consider using white noise machines or a fan to block out any background noise.\n3. **Set clear boundaries and expectations**: Let your child know that it's time for sleep and that they need to stay in bed. You can say something like, \"It's time for sleep, and I expect you to stay in your bed.

Static typing means the data type of a variable is known at compile time, which helps catch type-related errors early.

They created a machine that simulated the motion of a human tongue and used it to test several Tootsie Pops. According to their results, it takes an average of 364 licks to reach the center of a Tootsie Pop.\n\nHowever, other experiments have yielded different results.
