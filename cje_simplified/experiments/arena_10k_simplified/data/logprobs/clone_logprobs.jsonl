Each device has a copy of the model, and the model is trained on its portion of the data. Gradients are then aggregated (often averaged) across devices to update the model parameters.\n   - **Advantages**: Easy to implement, works well for large datasets.\n   - **Challenges**: Requires synchronizing gradients across devices, which can be communication-intensive.\n\n2. **Model Parallelism**:\n   - **Description**: Model parallelism involves splitting the neural network model across multiple devices. Each device is responsible for a portion of the model (e.g., certain layers or parts of layers).
