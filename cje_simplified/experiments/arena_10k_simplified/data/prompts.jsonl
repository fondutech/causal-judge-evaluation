{"prompt_id": "arena_74", "prompt": "Explain this:\nLarge pretrained Transformer language models have been shown to exhibit zeroshot generalization, i.e. they can perform a wide variety of tasks that they were\nnot explicitly trained on. However, the architectures and pretraining objectives\nused across state-of-the-art models differ significantly, and there has been limited\nsystematic comparison of these factors. In this work, we present a large-scale\nevaluation of modeling choices and their impact on zero-shot generalization. In\nparticular, we focus on text-to-text models and experiment with three model architectures (causal/non-causal decoder-only and encoder-decoder), trained with\ntwo different pretraining objectives (autoregressive and masked language modeling), and evaluated with and without multitask prompted finetuning. We train\nmodels with over 5 billion parameters for more than 170 billion tokens, thereby\nincreasing the likelihood that our conclusions will transfer to even larger scales.\nOur experiments show that causal decoder-only models trained on an autoregressive language modeling objective exhibit the strongest zero-shot generalization\nafter purely unsupervised pretraining. However, models with non-causal visibility on their input trained with a masked language modeling objective followed\nby multitask finetuning perform the best among our experiments. We therefore\nconsider the adaptation of pretrained models across architectures and objectives.\nWe find that pretrained non-causal decoder models can be adapted into performant\ngenerative", "language": "English"}

Our economy is dominated by tourism and many people here wish we could\ndiversify into some other areas so our economy could be more resilient.\nWe have ocean rights to around 40,000 sq-miles of ocean.\nOne idea I would like to \nexplore is using seasteads to do ocean fertilization to grow more plankton, so grow more fish, so we could fish\nmore without depleting fish stocks.   \nWe could have the seastead we are living on stay in the center of a large Eddy current.\nThen maybe twice a day we could use flying agriculture drone or a small boat drone to spread some fertilizer in the\n1 sq-km around the seastead.  \nWe would do a small amount of fertilizer like 20 lbs the first day and increase gradually to 200 lbs per day.\nWe plan to fly a multi-spectral drone to collect data.   We also plan to take water samples\nfrom near the seastead and do tests on those.   We would start data collection a few days before\nfertilization started so we had a baseline.\nWhat types of test should we do on the water samples?\nWhat other data collection could we do? \nWhat data would indicate something bad was happening and we should stop the experiment?\nFor now please ignore carbon sequestration, the politics and legality questions.", "language": "English"}

{"prompt_id": "arena_858", "prompt": "Summarize:\nOur work revolves around the concept of memory in neural architectures. Memory has been a\nrecurrent theme in neural network research, dating back to early works (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943;\nStephen, 1956) and significantly advancing in the 1990s with the introduction of the Backpropagation\nThrough Time learning algorithm (Werbos, 1990) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural\narchitecture (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). Contemporary memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) typically utilize some form of recurrent external memory separate from the model\u2019s\nparameters. Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) (Graves et al., 2014) and Memory Networks (Weston\net al., 2015) are equipped with storage for vector representations accessible through an attention\nmechanism. Memory Networks (Weston et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) were designed to\nenable reasoning through sequential attention over memory content.\nNTMs, followed by Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) (Graves et al., 2016) and Sparse DNC\n(Rae et al., 2016), are implemented as recurrent neural networks capable of writing to memory\nstorage over time. All these models are differentiable and trainable via backpropagation through\ntime (BPTT). Parallel research lines extend recurrent neural networks, such as LSTM, with data\nstructures like stacks, lists, or queues (Joulin and Mikolov, 2015; Grefenstette et al., 2015). MANN\narchitectures with more advanced addressing mechanisms, such as address-content separation and\nmulti-step addressing, have been propo", "language": "English"}

The primary objective of this study is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting water drinkability based on a specific set of input parameters.\n\nTo achieve this, various water quality parameters and methods were employed to assess water quality from diverse water sources. The collected data were then utilized in training a binary classification model, employing algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, XGBoost, and SVM. Input features included physical and chemical parameters like pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids, and conductivity, alongside other commonly used parameters in assessing water quality.\n\nThe SVM algorithm achieved the highest accuracy rate of 82.3% among all models, demonstrating its ability to predict the binary target column concerning water potability. The most significant parameters in determining water drinkability were pH, total dissolved solids, and hardness.\n\nThe model's output can assist in making informed decisions regarding water quality and serve as a valuable tool in improving access to safe drinking water. Moreover, the model's scalability enables deployment online, allowing individuals to assess water quality in their vicinity.\n\nOverall, this project underscores machine learning's potential in addressing critical public health iss", "language": "English"}

It captures the dependencies and relationships between variables, such as input features and output labels in a data-driven system or between players' strategies and outcomes in a game theory setting.\n\nIn the context of a Markov category, a generative channel can be represented as a morphism between objects, where objects capture the structure of probability spaces, and morphisms represent stochastic processes or conditional probability distributions. The composition of morphisms in a Markov category embodies the concept of sequential stochastic processes, where the output of one channel serves as the input for the next.\n\nGenerative chan", "language": "English"}

In this work, we\napply S4 to Machine Translation (MT), and\nevaluate several encoder-decoder variants\non WMT\u201914 and WMT\u201916. In contrast\nwith the success in language modeling, we\nfind that S4 lags behind the Transformer by\napproximately 4 BLEU points, and that it\ncounter-intuitively struggles with long sentences.\nFinally, we show that this gap is\ncaused by S4\u2019s inability to summarize the\nfull source sentence in a single hidden state,\nand show that we can close the gap by introducing\nan attention mechanism.\n1 Introduction\nThe Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is the most\npopular architecture for state-of-the-art Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) (Devlin et al., 2019;\nBrown et al., 2020; NLLB Team et al., 2022).
