However, the architectures and pretraining objectives\nused across state-of-the-art models differ significantly, and there has been limited\nsystematic comparison of these factors. In this work, we present a large-scale\nevaluation of modeling choices and their impact on zero-shot generalization. In\nparticular, we focus on text-to-text models and experiment with three model architectures (causal/non-causal decoder-only and encoder-decoder), trained with\ntwo different pretraining objectives (autoregressive and masked language modeling), and evaluated with and without multitask prompted finetuning. We train\nmodels with over 5 billion parameters for more than 170 billion tokens, thereby\nincreasing the likelihood that our conclusions will transfer to even larger scales.\nOur experiments show that causal decoder-only models trained on an autoregressive language modeling objective exhibit the strongest zero-shot generalization\nafter purely unsupervised pretraining. However, models with non-causal visibility on their input trained with a masked language modeling objective followed\nby multitask finetuning perform the best among our experiments.
