{"prompt_id": "test_3", "prompt": "How do I make a paper airplane?", "response": "The classic paper airplane! Making one is a fun and easy activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Here's a step-by-step guide to making a basic paper airplane:\n\n**Materials:**\n\n* One piece of paper (A4 or letter size, 8.5 x 11 inches)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Take the paper and fold it in half** lengthwise, so that one long edge meets the other. Unfold the paper and then fold it in half again, creating a crease in the paper.\n2. **Open the paper and fold the top corners** down so that they meet the middle crease you made in step 1. The folds should be symmetrical and about 1 inch deep.\n3. **Next, fold the bottom corners** up so that they meet the middle crease. Again, the folds should be symmetrical and about 1 inch deep.\n4. **Fold the top edge** of the paper down along the crease you made in step 1. The fold should be about 0.5 inches deep.\n5. **Take the wings** (the two flaps on either side of the plane) and fold them down so that they are even with the bottom edge of the plane. The folds should be about 1 inch deep.\n6. **Give the plane a gentle pull** to make sure everything is in place.\n7. **Your plane is now ready to fly!** Gently toss it forward, making sure it's flat and even.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Use a smooth, flat surface to launch your plane.\n* Make sure the folds are crisp and sharp to help the plane fly smoothly.\n* Experiment with different folding techniques and designs to create different types of paper airplanes.\n* Practice makes perfect! Don't be discouraged if your first few attempts don't fly well \u2013 keep trying, and you'll get the hang of it.\n\n**Variations:**\n\nThere are many different designs and variations of paper airplanes you can try. Some popular ones include:\n\n* The \"Dart\" design: a more streamlined and pointed plane that flies fast and straight.\n* The \"Glider\" design: a more curved and stable plane that glides smoothly through the air.\n* The \"Stunt\" design: a more complex plane with flaps and other features that allow it to perform tricks and stunts.\n\nI hope this helps!

The response also includes helpful tips and mentions variations, showing good completeness, but the core instructions are too ambiguous to be properly helpful. The response ends with an appropriate follow-up question."}}
