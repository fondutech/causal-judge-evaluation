{"prompt_id": "test_3", "prompt": "How do I make a paper airplane?", "response": "A classic request! Making a paper airplane is a simple and fun activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Here's a step-by-step guide to make a basic paper airplane:\n\n**You'll need:**\n\n* One piece of A4 or letter-sized paper (8.5 x 11 inches)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Take the paper and fold it in half** lengthwise, so that one long edge meets the other. Unfold the paper and then fold it in half again, the same way. This will create a crease in the paper.\n2. **Open the paper and fold the top corners** down so that they meet the middle crease you made in step 1. The folds should be symmetrical and about 1 inch deep.\n3. **Fold the bottom corners** up so that they meet the middle crease. Again, the folds should be symmetrical and about 1 inch deep.\n4. **Fold the top edge** of the paper down along the crease you made in step 1. The fold should be about 0.5 inches deep.\n5. **Fold the wings** down along the crease you made in step 1. The folds should be about 1 inch deep and symmetrical.\n6. **Give the plane a gentle pull** to make sure everything is in place.\n7. **Your plane is ready to fly!** Gently toss the plane forward, making sure it's flat and even. You can adjust the angle of the wings to control the flight.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure your folds are crisp and sharp.\n* Use a smooth, gentle motion when throwing the plane.\n* Experiment with different folding techniques and designs to create different types of paper airplanes.\n* Practice makes perfect! Don't be discouraged if your first few attempts don't fly well.\n\n**Variations:**\n\nThere are many different designs and variations of paper airplanes you can try. Some popular ones include:\n\n* The \"Dart\" design: This is a more streamlined version of the basic plane, with a narrower nose and more pointed wings.\n* The \"Glider\" design: This plane has a more curved wing shape and is designed to glide smoothly through the air.\n\nI hope this helps!

However, the instructions are vague and confusing, particularly in steps 2, 3, and 4, which describe folding corners and edges without clear reference to which corners or edges are being folded. The lack of visual aids or clearer descriptions makes it difficult for a user to accurately follow the instructions. Additionally, the response mentions variations like the \"Dart\" and \"Glider\" designs but provides no specific instructions for these, making the suggestions less helpful. The overall clarity and accuracy are compromised by the ambiguous instructions, reducing the practical usefulness of the response."}}
