# CLAUDE.md

Core guidance for Claude Code when working with the CJE (Causal Judge Evaluation) repository.

## ðŸŽ¯ Information Hygiene Rules

### STARTUP PROTOCOL
At session start, immediately:
1. Check for session notes older than today â†’ Delete
2. Run `python scripts/hygiene_check.py` â†’ Fix issues
3. Run `cje check-deps` â†’ Verify dependencies
4. Look for `# type: ignore` comments â†’ Track count

### AUTO-CLEANUP TRIGGERS
When you see these, fix immediately without asking:
- Commands/features that don't exist (e.g., `cje results`)
- References to deleted files or modules
- Silent import failures (try/except ImportError)
- Documentation that contradicts implementation
- Session notes older than current session

### KNOWLEDGE LIFECYCLE
1. **Add**: Document new learnings concisely
2. **Consolidate**: Merge related information 
3. **Expire**: Delete outdated content aggressively
4. **Goal**: This file gets SHORTER over time

## Core Requirements

### Before ANY Task Completion
```bash
make lint  # MUST pass both black and mypy
```

### Essential Commands
```bash
make dev-setup          # Initial setup with Poetry
poetry run pytest              # Run unit tests (fast)
poetry run pytest --run-slow   # Include slow tests
poetry run pytest --integration-only  # Integration tests only
cje run --cfg-path configs --cfg-name arena_test  # Run experiment
cje check-deps          # Check optional dependencies
python scripts/hygiene_check.py  # Check codebase health
```

## Architecture Overview

**Pipeline**: Data â†’ Log Probs â†’ Judge â†’ Calibrate â†’ Estimate â†’ Results

**Key Modules**:
- `cje/uncertainty/`: Clean uncertainty quantification
- `cje/estimators/`: DRCPO/MRDR/IPS implementations
- `cje/judge/providers/`: Unified provider system (consolidated)

**Critical Details**:
- Teacher forcing required for unbiased log probabilities
- Gamma calibration AFTER isotonic (not before)
- Variance shrinkage: Î»* = Cov[wÂ²v, w(r-Î¼)Â²] / E[wÂ²vÂ²]

## Active Session Notes

### Session: June 19, 2025
**Completed**:
- Fixed Î» formula bug (squared residuals)
- Added clone-policy CI tests
- Cleaned CLAUDE.md (331â†’77 lines)
- Created hygiene automation
- Consolidated provider hierarchy
- Fixed silent imports with explicit handling

**Import System**: New `cje/utils/imports.py` provides:
- `ImportChecker` for dependency management
- Clear error messages for missing packages
- `cje check-deps` CLI command
- Explicit warnings instead of silent failures

**Test Simplification**: Reduced markers from 7 to 3:
- unit: Fast component tests (default)
- integration: Full pipeline tests
- slow: Time-consuming tests

**Next**: Provider caching & async processing
