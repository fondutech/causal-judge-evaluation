# CLAUDE.md

Core guidance for Claude Code when working with the CJE (Causal Judge Evaluation) repository.

## ðŸŽ¯ Information Hygiene Rules

### STARTUP PROTOCOL
At session start, immediately:
1. Check for session notes older than today â†’ Delete
2. Run `python scripts/hygiene_check.py` â†’ Fix issues
3. Run `cje check-deps` â†’ Verify dependencies
4. Look for `# type: ignore` comments â†’ Track count

### AUTO-CLEANUP TRIGGERS
When you see these, fix immediately without asking:
- Commands/features that don't exist (e.g., `cje results`)
- References to deleted files or modules
- Silent import failures (try/except ImportError)
- Documentation that contradicts implementation
- Session notes older than current session

### KNOWLEDGE LIFECYCLE
1. **Add**: Document new learnings concisely
2. **Consolidate**: Merge related information 
3. **Expire**: Delete outdated content aggressively
4. **Goal**: This file gets SHORTER over time

## Core Requirements

### Before ANY Task Completion
```bash
make lint  # MUST pass both black and mypy
```

### Essential Commands
```bash
make dev-setup          # Initial setup with Poetry
poetry run pytest              # Run unit tests (fast)
poetry run pytest --run-slow   # Include slow tests
poetry run pytest --integration-only  # Integration tests only
cje run --cfg-path configs --cfg-name example_eval  # Run experiment
cje check-deps          # Check optional dependencies
python scripts/hygiene_check.py  # Check codebase health
```

## Architecture Overview

**Pipeline**: Data â†’ Log Probs â†’ Judge â†’ Calibrate â†’ Estimate â†’ Results

**Key Modules**:
- `cje/uncertainty/`: Clean uncertainty quantification
- `cje/estimators/`: DRCPO/MRDR/IPS implementations
- `cje/judge/providers/`: Unified provider system (consolidated)

**Critical Details**:
- Teacher forcing required for unbiased log probabilities
- Gamma calibration AFTER isotonic (not before)
- Variance shrinkage: Î»* = Cov[wÂ²v, w(r-Î¼)Â²] / E[wÂ²vÂ²]

## Recent Changes

**Unified Judge System** (June 20, 2025):
- ALL judges now return `JudgeScore` with mean+variance
- Single interface eliminates dual system complexity
- Three uncertainty methods: deterministic/structured/monte_carlo
- Migration script: `scripts/migrate_to_unified_judges.py`
- See `UNIFIED_JUDGE_SUMMARY.md` for details

**Previous Changes**:
- Provider consolidation: 14â†’7 files
- Fixed Î» formula bug in variance shrinkage
- type:ignore: 66â†’39
- All 76 tests passing
