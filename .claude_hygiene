      action: "Remove after confirming"
  
  - contradictory_docs:
      rule: "Docs mentioning non-existent commands/files"
      action: "Update or remove"

## DURING-SESSION RULES

continuous_monitoring:
  - before_creating_file:
      check: "Does similar functionality exist?"
      action: "Consolidate instead of duplicate"
  
  - before_adding_docs:
      check: "Does this make something else obsolete?"
      action: "Remove old when adding new"
  
  - when_fixing_bug:
      check: "Is this documented as a gotcha?"
      action: "Update docs to reflect fix"

## END-SESSION PROTOCOL

cleanup_tasks:
  - consolidate_learnings:
      action: "Merge related discoveries into principles"
  
  - expire_temporary:
      action: "Remove any 'temporary' or 'quick fix' code"
  
  - update_claude_md:
      required_sections:
        - "Active Session Notes" (max 5 lines)

      remove:
        - Previous session notes
        - Completed items
        - Verbose explanations

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO DETECT

red_flags:
  - file_patterns:
      - "*_old.py"
      - "*_backup.*"
      - "test_*.py" outside tests/
      - "temp_*.*"
  
  - code_patterns:
      - "# TODO: Remove this"
      - "# HACK:"
      - "# type: ignore" (track count)
      - "pass  # pragma: no cover"
  
  - doc_patterns:
      - "Coming soon"
      - "Not yet implemented"
      - "Deprecated but kept for compatibility"
      - References to deleted features

## METRICS TO TRACK

hygiene_metrics:
  - claude_md_length:
      target: "Decrease over time"
      alert: "If grows >20% in one session"
  
  - type_ignore_count:
      target: "Zero"
      track: "Per module"
  
  - duplicate_functions:
      target: "Zero"
      check: "Similar names or docstrings"
  
  - test_coverage:
      target: ">80%"
      focus: "New code must have tests"
